# C++ Business Logic Engine

This module represents the core computation layer of the system.
It is designed to be independent from the frontend and focuses
purely on business rules and performance-critical calculations.

## Responsibilities
- Pricing and cost aggregation
- Margin and profitability logic
- Deterministic, testable business rules

## Why C++
- High performance
- Predictable execution
- Suitable for financial and enterprise systems

## Architecture Role
Frontend (HTML/JS) → API Layer (Python/Node) → C++ Engine

The C++ engine is intended to be integrated via:
- REST APIs
- Microservices
- Native bindings (future scope)

This design follows real-world enterprise architecture patterns.
Hi everyone 👋,

I’ve built a business-focused technology consulting website using GitHub Pages
and structured the repository with a clear separation of concerns.

### Project Structure
- `/docs` → Static frontend (HTML, CSS, JS) deployed via GitHub Pages
- `/logic` → C++ core logic layer (business rules / computation engine)
- `/backend` → Reserved for future API or service integration
- SEO files (`robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`) included

### Key Point
The C++ code is **not intended to run in the browser**.
It represents a **high-performance backend / engine layer** that could be
integrated later via APIs (Python, REST, microservices, etc.).

My goal was to demonstrate:
- Clean architecture
- Real-world system design
- Separation between UI and core business logic

### What I’d like feedback on:
1. Is this repository structure aligned with real-world / enterprise practices?
2. Is it acceptable to include C++ logic as an engine layer alongside a static frontend?
3. Any suggestions to improve clarity or scalability?

This is meant to be **production-style design**, not a beginner demo.

Thanks in advance for your feedback .
## C++ Business Logic Engine

This module represents a standalone computation layer designed
for enterprise systems.

Responsibilities:
- Financial metrics calculation
